    <h1>Welcome to the Randall Reader  Project Website!</h1>
    <p>The Randall Reader is currently just an idea. I am planning to create a portable text-file reader, using the Doubletalk text-to-speech voice popular toward the end of the last century. </p>
<a href="manual.html"> The User's manual</a> is a work in progress and outlines a final, aspirational design for the first version of the device.
<a href="blog.html"> My development diary</a> will chart the progress of the project, starting today with the first delivery of the necessary hardware to take this from an idea to a reality.
<p> If you are interested in discussing the project further with me, you can:
